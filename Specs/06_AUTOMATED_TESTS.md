# Automated Tests

I want to build some automated unit tests, starting with non-UI components. 
Pls make me a list of easy-to-test components. I would expect that I may have to change the interface of some of them, in order to inject some of the dependencies for testing purposes. I would probably also have to import some pictures into the Xcode environment in order to test the Image analysis services.
